# Look
Look is a powerful machine learning tool designed to uplscale satellite images, including infrared (IR), ultraviolet (UV), and visible spectrum images, generated by a GAN built with TensorFlow Keras. Integrated with Django, it ensures high-quality scaling while preserving details and consistency, making the images ready for further use or visualization. Scaly is ideal for enhancing images while maintaining precision
